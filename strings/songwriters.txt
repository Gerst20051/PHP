Fabrizio De André

Vol. 1° (1967)

and also: Tutti morimmo a stento; La buona novella; Creuza de ma. 

Fabrizio De André was the most important and brilliant italian songwriter. He wrote several somber acoustic ballads that radically changed the role of the figure of italian intellectual-songwriter; his lyrics are capable of creating aching fairytalesque atmospheres and revealing author's deepest torments: a pessimistic view of life in society, a defiant attitude against any sort of political power, a hymn at the truest sense of human freedom, an unbearably tragic sense of human existence and a strong intimist religious tension. Good terms of comparison can be Leonard Cohen or Georges Brassens, but, unfortunately, I'm afraid non-italian-speakers miss something, since most of the charm in De André's songs is due to poetic and evocative power of his lyrics...but maybe there are some exceptions: last albums (like Creuza de ma, Anime salve) are something very different from early works. They contain not acoustic ballads, but world music-oriented compositions: in these albums arrangements play a main part and even if you can't understand lyrics you can still enjoy music.

Franco Battiato

Fetus (1971)

*** 
and also: Pollution, Sulle corde di Aries, La voce del padrone 

A well-known italian artist, whose artistic worthiness is largely recognized even abroad. During his career, Battiato was always on the move: he started with highly experimental albums (Fetus, Pollution, Sulle corde di Aries, Clic, etc.) and then suddenly shifted to easy listening compositions, creating a personal style made up of catchy but also refined pop melodies and very eclectic and eccentric lyrics (significant albums of this period are L'era del cinghiale bianco, Patriots, La voce del padrone, Caffè de la Paix). Besides he also produced many artists (such as Alice, Giuni Russo, Juri Camisasca, etc.)

Giorgio Gaber

Far finta di essere sani (1973)

and also: Polli d'allevamento; Libertà obbligatoria; Dialogo tra un impegnato e un non so 

Gaber is the most "difficult" italian songwriter for foreign listeners and I'm afraid I can hardly recommend his records to non-italian-speakers, because, in order to fully appreciate his albums, you have to deeply know italian sociopolitical situation in the '70s...and of course, you have to manage italian language, since Gaber's lyrics are full of irony (and irony is one of the most difficult things to translate).

Mauro Pelosi

Al mercato degli uomini piccoli (1973)

*** 
In a way, this album is the exact opposite of many Fabrizio De André's albums: a strong attention is focused on the music (proggy arrangements à la Wyatt), but lyrics are - we have to admite it - very poor and sometimes ingenuous. That means: if you don't understand italian, you'll probably enjoy Pelosi more than De André, but if you are looking for more poetic and deeper lyrics, then listen to De André.

Lucio Battisti

Anima latina (1974)

***1/2 
Probably, this is the best italian pop album of all times. If you like it, try also Don Giovanni, that contains songs with very cryptic lyrics, but please avoid some Battisti's popular hit songs such as "Acqua azzurra acqua chiara", "Dieci ragazze", "Un'avventura": they are just nice, not brilliant.

Lucio Dalla

Come è profondo il mare (1977)

**1/2 
Lucio Dalla is one of the most prolific italian songwriters. Unfortunately, last albums are very horrible. But albums recorded in the '70s (Come è profondo il mare, first of all) are worthy of note, since in these albums Dalla managed to merge jazzy melodic elements with catchy pop melodies, serious thinking with vulgar expressions, refined puns with explicit sex allusions.

*** 

Recently reissued as Dell'universo assente, containing many bonus tracks.

Giorgio Moroder

From Here to Eternity (1977)

*** 
I used to underrate this album, probably because I hate recent mainstream dance music (not only the shitty "music" in itself, but also all the trimmings: dance clubs, stupid people with awful taste in clothes, and so on) and I used to see Moroder as the person responsible for this social evil. It took me several years to realize the worthiness of this cool moustached man.

Chrisma

Chinese Restaurant (1977)

***1/2 

One of the best italian records ever. A strongly inspired synth-punk album in which you can hear a lot of musical references: Kraftwerk, NEU!, Suicide, David Bowie's Low, progressive electronic, Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, ambient electronic, british synth-pop, Roxy Music, Brian Eno, french pop, Yellow Magic Orchestra...and there's even a  - how could I call it? -  "synth-hard-rock" song (What For)! 
Furthermore, look at the issue date: a forward-looking album, too. 

and also: Hibernation (***)

Antonio Sangiuliano

Take Off (1978)

*** 
Antonio Sangiuliano is an obscure tuscane composer, whose first album, Take Off, was a mostly instrumental album reminiscent of atmospheres typical of Berlin School and Progressive Electronic (artists and bands such as Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream) with a special taste for symphonic and baroque arrangements. For this reason the album is rather unusual for the italian progressive rock scene of the 70s. 
His second album, Out of Breath, was never issued. The artist has also composed several soundtracks and currently conducts a radio program for RAI (italian public service broadcaster).

Matia Bazar

Tango (1983)

*** 
I strongly think this is an album that can compete even with some well-renowned british synth-pop classics, since it has all the indispensable features to do it: catchy melodies (the most memorable is beyond all doubt Vacanze romane), cheesy (but in the same time refined) arrangements, presentuous (but not irritating) soprano vocals, futuristic (but also classical) atmospheres, smart and never banal lyrics. And if you think these songs are kitsch...well, tell me, have you ever listened to some kitsch songs more elegant than these?

Raw Power

Screams From the Gutter (1984)

*** 
Great hardcore/thrash metal album. Raw Power played in many live shows in the USA with bands like Circle Jerks, Adolescents, DOA, Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Agnostic Front, Dead Kennedys, Suicidal Tendencies, Guns'n'Roses.
 
25	
	
Diaframma

Siberia (1984)

*** 
Speaking frankly, Diaframma maybe never created something very original (they just reinterpreted british dark wave stylemes), but "Siberia" is a still valid and enjoyable album (probably the best example of italian dark wave) and almost every song in it is touching and unforgettable, with highly poetic lyrics.

Litfiba

Desaparecido (1985)

**1/2 
Later works recorded by this (for better or for worse) historic italian band are really, really disgusting. But this debut album, as well as early (and unknown) EPs (Guerra, Transea, Yassassin), is worthy of note. Probably the music is not so original (influence of british new wave is undoubtable) but every song is enjoable, thanks to strongly evocative lyrics, somber atmospheres, fascinations for mediterranean and middle-eastern melodies, masterly abilities of musicians (expecially of bass player Gianni Maroccolo) and charima of the frontman Piero Pelù: a formula, unfortunately, lasted just a few years. As a matter of fact, after Maroccolo left the band (for joining CCCP Fedeli alla Linea and later Consorzio Suonatori Indipendenti), the music became a mediocre hard rock (with albums such as El diablo, Colpo di coda, Terremoto) and then even a trivial and petty dance-pop (Mondi sommersi, Infinito). With these last albums, every strong point in Litfiba turned into a weak point: Maroccolo was replaced by Terzani (an insipid bass player), lyrics became banal, guitar player Renzulli paraded presumptive (but actually dull) technical skills and Pelù's vocals became simply irritating.

Not Moving

Sinnermen (1986)

*** 
How can this album be so unknown? It deserve to be mentioned among the most interesting italian albums ever, since its style is quite unique in italian rock music: it's a frentic and lively mixture of voodoobilly, british post-punk, punk blues, beach punk and roots-rock.Yes, the production was very poor, but these guys had a lot of imagination and energy!

Schizo

Main Frame Collapse (1989)

Marlene Kuntz

Catartica (1994)

*** 
When people talk about italian so-called alternative rock bands of the '90s, almost certainly they mention Marlene Kuntz and Afterhours as mean exponents of the scene. The former is a noise rock band with musical expedients undoubtedly taken from Sonic Youth. Nevertheless Marlene Kuntz managed to reach something a bit original in their first two albums (Catartica and Il vile) mixing noisy guitars with heavy sound and with extremely nihilist and misanthropic (but also, in their own way, poetic) lyrics. 
(try also: Il vile)

Massimo Volume

Lungo i bordi (1995)

***1/2 
One of my favorite italian "rock" album of all times: Massimo Volume was an epoch-making band, since they managed to create an innovative formula: post-rock-like arrangements (thanks to Egle Sommacal's angular guitar riffs) with the vocalist (Mimì Clementi, also in El-Muniria) reciting highly poetic lyrics with a strong evocative power (sometimes they can seem a cinema scenario portraying a cold autumn night somewhere in a big and desolate city...)
 
34	
	
La Crus

La crus (1995)

*** 
Jazzy and folky songs merging trip-hop elements (sombre atmospheres, minimal electronic, etc.) with a chansonnier feeling. So try it if you like Portishead but also if you like De André, Brassens, and so on. Very personal covers of old italian songs (Il vino, originally recorded by Ciampi and Angela, written by Tenco).

Afterhours

Hai paura del buio? (1997)

**1/2 (+1/2?) 
Afterhours is probably the most idolized band in the italian so-called alternative rock scene, and Hai paura del buio? is one of the most idolized italian rock albums of all times. I think this is due to the stagnant situation of italian musical culture when it was issued: in 1997 the majority of italians didn't know so many music genres (maybe only grunge) and many of them were waiting for a sort of messiah, an italian version of Nirvana. In this sad context, Hai paura del buio? came as a bolt from the blue: it was immediately labelled the italian response to Nirvana's Nevermind; but obviously this was a nonsense (its style was completely different and it was issued six years later than Nevermind: a quite late response, isn't it?). Putting aside its negligible historical value and trying to judge the music, we can say that the album has certainly many smart songs merging several genres (punk, hardcore, grunge, pop), but also a lot of fillers and as a result the album is not only enjoyable and wideranging but also redundant, prolix and even arrogant; arrogant as the band frontman (Manuel Agnelli), who stated that this album was the italian version of Mellon Collie and the Inifinite Sadness, the song "Male di miele" was the italian "Smells Like Teen Spirits" and his style in writing lyrics was a "cut-up" à-la William Burroughs... 
I mean, this is still a recommendable album, after all. But it's enormously overrated here in Italy. 
After this album, Afterhours never managed to do an album really valid: Non è per sempre and Quello che non c'è are dull pop-rock albums with a lot of useless mainstrem songs; Ballate per piccole iene was a half-failed attempt to merge alternative rock with a serious and more mature songwriting and I milanesi ammazzano il sabato was a inconclusive return to their early noisy and aggressive sound adding a stoner-rock leaning. In 2009 they even competed for Sanremo prize singing an insipid and pointless song (and they passed it off as an alternative song!). 
But the most hateful thing of all is that Agnelli's songwriting became just conceited, verbose, shallow and irritatingly intellectual-wannabe: he always remarked his intolerance for faked alternative people, but now he's their revered king.

Uochi Toki

Libro audio (2009)

**1/2 (+1/2?) 
Voto più che mai provvisorio. Per ora metto un 6½-7 "di fiducia" (ma di una fiducia un po' "traballante", si noti bene...), ma sono piuttosto disorientato: se dovessi valutare esclusivamente i testi (a tratti veramente intelligenti, lo riconosco), direi che siamo senza dubbio davanti ad un gran disco; ma dato che è la musica ad avere la priorità in un disco di musica (perdonatemi la tautologia, ma era d'obbligo!), lasciamo un attimo i testi da parte ed ammettiamo, anzi, che è proprio "per colpa" loro che l'accompagnamento musicale di queste canzoni necessita di svariati ri-ascolti per poter essere giudicato a mente fredda...e per pervenire, comunque, ad una certezza inoppugnabile (checché se ne dica in giro): i Uochi Toki fanno buona musica, ma non molto originale (e, ancor meno, geniale). Prima si ascoltino bene i Dälek o i cLOUDDEAD e poi si ammetta, in tutta onestà, che solo in alcuni episodi (su tutti, L'osservatore) i Uochi Toki possono lontanamente reggere il paragone con i suddetti artisti stranieri. Rimane senza dubbio il più riuscito disco hip-hop italiano, ma quei modelli di riferimento restano distanti anni luce. 
In ogni caso, anche se dovessi rivalutarlo, il voto cambierebbe, penso, di poco; il fatto è che, però, lo sto riascoltando da troppo tempo e mi sto stufando di "altalenare" continuamente tra uno stato d'estasi ed uno di disillusione e così via...uno dei dischi più faticosi da valutare che mi sia capitato per le mani: penso proprio che per un bel po' staccherò la spina.
